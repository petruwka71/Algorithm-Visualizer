# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
The **Algorithm Visualizer** is a Python application designed to demonstrate how sorting algorithms work. It provides a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using a simple and intuitive graphical interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic visualization** of sorting steps.
- Interactive and educational interface.
- Customizable for adding more algorithms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```
3. Ensure Python 3 and Tkinter are installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python algorithm_visualizer.py
   ```
2. Click the "Start Bubble Sort" button to begin the visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Include speed controls for the visualization.
- Add real-time graph updates for additional data insights.
